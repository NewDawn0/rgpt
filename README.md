Bring the Power of ChatGPT to the Command Line with RGPT - A Rust-Based CLI ChatGPT Client
Inspired by [shell_gpt](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt)

## Description
RGPT is a powerful CLI chatbot client that combines the speed of the command line with the flexibility of chatbots. Built with the Rust programming language, RGPT offers faster performance, more reliable code, fewer dependency issues, easier maintenance, more secure code, easier debugging, easier extension, easier optimization, and more options than its Python counterpart. RGPT has a variety of configuration options that can be invoked using the command line. These include interactive mode, a descriptive help menu, syntax highlighting in code snippets, code mode, shell mode, and executable mode. Additionally, RGPT has the ability to configure the model (Davinci, Curie, Ada, or Babbage), the max tokens, the temperature, and the accuracy. RGPT is available through the Cargo install command or via a Docker container.
